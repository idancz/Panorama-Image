## Projective Transformation Equations
Building a system of equations of the form ùê¥ùë• = ùëè, for projective transformation as follow:

<br /> 
When X is the source coordinate and v',u' are the destination coordinate.<br /> 
You should use at least 4 pair of points in order to solve 8 degrees of freedom.<br /> 
The solution of the system is the eigenvector corresponding to the minimal eigenvalue.<br /> 
I used SVD decomposition in order to find the solution.  

## RANSAC Algorithm
w -> percentage of inliers (in our case 80%)<br />
p -> probability of success (in our case 99%)<br />
n -> minimal pairs of point to calculate a model (in our case 4)<br />
k ‚Äì> number of iteration of RANSAC algorithm<br />
Assuming that:<br />

<br />
We rounded k and increase by +1 to avoid the case where w=1
<br />
k = ‚åàk‚åâ + 1 = 10 
<br />
<br />
Loop for k iteration:
  - Sample n pairs of points randomly.
  - Compute the model (homography) using the random points.
  - Find inliers (all the points with distance < t) using the calculated homography.
  - If number of inliers > d:
    - Recompute the model (homography) using all inliers.
    - If error < previous error:
      - Save the model (homography).
      
Return the best model (homography).
### RANSAC Forward

### RANSAC Backward
First calculated the backward homography using RANSAC, then applied it and finally computed bilinear interpolation.

## Panorama Algorithm
- Computing forward homography using RANSAC.
- Finding panorama shape (using the forward homography).
- Calculate backward homography by inverse and normalization of the forward homography<br />

- Apply translation on the backward homography to get the panorama homography.
- Create panorama clear canvas.
- Perform backward warping of the source image using the panorama homography.
- Plant the destination image in the panorama canvas.
- Place the backward warped image into the panorama ‚Äúfree‚Äù space.
- Return the panorama image.
